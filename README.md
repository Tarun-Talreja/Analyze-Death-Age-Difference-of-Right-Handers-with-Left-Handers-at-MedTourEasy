# Analyze Death Age Difference of Right Handers with Left Handers at MedTourEasy

## Overview
This project focused on analyzing the correlation between left-handedness and life expectancy using Bayesian statistics and pandas. The study challenged the common belief that left-handed individuals have a shorter lifespan. Through comprehensive analysis of age distribution data over time, the project provided insights into the longevity of left-handed individuals and refuted the claim that left-handed people die earlier.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Bayesian Statistics

## Key Features
- **Statistical Analysis:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis using Bayesian statistics to investigate the correlation between handedness and life expectancy.
- **Data Distribution Analysis:** Analyzed age distribution data over time to assess the impact of changing rates of left-handedness on average age at death.
- **Myth Debunking:** Successfully refuted the claim that left-handed people die earlier, contributing to a more accurate understanding of handedness and longevity.

## Installation/Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository and install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the analysis scripts provided in the `src/` folder.
3. Review the results and visualizations generated by the scripts.

## Usage
- Use the scripts to analyze the age distribution and correlation between handedness and life expectancy.
- Explore the findings to gain insights into the longevity of left-handed individuals.

## Results/Outcomes
- **Insightful Findings:** Provided a comprehensive analysis that debunked the myth of reduced life expectancy for left-handed individuals.
- **Accurate Understanding:** Contributed to a more accurate understanding of the relationship between handedness and longevity.
